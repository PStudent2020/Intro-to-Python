Summary:	This class will start with the basics of Python, leveraging the Git version control system, the Spyder IDE, and the Anaconda package manager to get students up and running meaningful code as quickly as possible. As time permits, we will cover use cases involving:
•	Flexible Data Transformation and Manipulation (Pandas Package)
•	Data Mining and Visualization (Package Matplotlib)

Course	Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
Objectives:	
•	Install and	run the	Anaconda installation, including the Python interpreter and Jupyter Notebooks
•	Understand and explain Python data structures and operations
•	Create and execute Python programs
•	Understand the concepts of file I/O
•	Be able to read data from text files into Pandas DataFrames
•	Plot data using appropriate Python visualization package Matplotlib

All exams are “Open Book/Open Notes”, and you may make full use of your computer and the Internet. You may not, however, share materials or information with other students.

NOTE: At the end of the semester, I will drop your lowest assignment grade. This adjustment is meant to allow for the fact that “stuff happens”, including illnesses, and should be held in reserve for emergencies. If you find yourself missing more than one assignment due to illness or other factors, then you should contact me as soon as possible to discuss whether you will be able to continue with the class.

Participation and Quizzes

You are expected to have completed all asynchronous assignments during the times frames indicated. Synchronous discussion and help sessions will be hosted using Zoom. All synchronous sessions are optional, but students are encouraged to participate in at least one discussion section per week. 

Assignments

Reading/viewing/installation assignments should be completed PRIOR to the dates indicated in the syllabus. Late assignments will not be accepted, and all assignments will be posted on Course Site and will be due at 12:00 PM (i.e., noon) Eastern Standard Time on the posted due date unless otherwise indicated.

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

Lehigh University is committed to maintaining an equitable and inclusive community and welcomes students with disabilities into all of the University’s educational programs.  In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, a student with a disability must contact Disability Support Services (DSS), provide documentation, and participate in an interactive review process.  If the documentation supports a request for reasonable accommodations, DSS will provide students with a Letter of Accommodations. Students who are approved for accommodations at Lehigh should share this letter and discuss their accommodations and learning needs with instructors as early in the semester as possible. Please note that I will not be able to honor any request for accommodation without at least seven (7) day’s advance notice. For more information or to request services, please contact Disability Support Services in person in Williams Hall, Suite 301, via phone at 610-758-4152, via email at indss@lehigh.edu, or online at https://studentaffairs.lehigh.edu/disabilities. 

The Principles of Our Equitable Community: 

 Lehigh University endorses The Principles of Our Equitable Community [http://www.lehigh.edu/~inprv/initiatives/PrinciplesEquity_Sheet_v2_032212.pdf]. We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.
Statement of Academic Integrity, Lehigh University Student Senate

“We, the Lehigh University Student Senate, as the standing representative body of all undergraduates, reaffirm the duty and obligation of the students to meet and uphold the highest principles and values of personal, moral and ethical conduct.  As partners in our educational community, both students and faculty share the responsibility for promoting and helping to ensure an environment of academic integrity.  As such, each student is expected to complete all academic course work in accordance to the standards set forth by the faculty and in compliance with the university’s Code of Conduct.”

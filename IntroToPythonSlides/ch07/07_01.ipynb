    "### **NumPy** (**Numerical Python**) Library\n",
    "* First appeared in 2006 and is the **preferred Python array implementation**.\n",
    "* High-performance, richly functional **_n_-dimensional array** type called **`ndarray`**. \n",
    "* **Written in C** and **up to 100 times faster than lists**.\n",
    "* Critical in big-data processing, AI applications and much more. \n",
    "* According to `libraries.io`, **over 450 Python libraries depend on NumPy**. \n",
    "* Many popular data science libraries such as Pandas, SciPy (Scientific Python) and Keras (for deep learning) are built on or depend on NumPy. "

    "# 11.6 Searching and Sorting\n",
    "* Searching data involves determining whether a value (referred to as the search key) is present in the data and, if so, finding its location\n",
    "    * Two popular search algorithms are the simple linear search and the faster but more complex binary search\n",
    "* Sorting places data in ascending or descending order, based on one or more sort keys\n",
    "* We selection sort and insertion sort, along with the more efficient but more complex merge sort"

    "# 11.10 Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "* Sorting data is one of the most important computing applications\n",
    "* Virtually every organization must sort some data, and often massive amounts of it\n",
    "* The end result—the sorted array—will be the same no matter which algorithm you use to sort the array\n",
    "* Choice of algorithm affects only the run time and memory use of the program."

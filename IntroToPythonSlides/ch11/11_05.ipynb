    "# 11.5 Recursion vs. Iteration\n",
    "* Both iteration and recursion are based on a control statement\n",
    "    * Iteration uses an iteration statement \n",
    "    * Recursion uses a selection statement \n",
    "* Both involve iteration\n",
    "    * Iteration explicitly uses an iteration statement\n",
    "    * Recursion achieves iteration through repeated function calls\n",
    "* Both involve a termination test\n",
    "    * Iteration terminates when the loop-continuation condition fails\n",
    "    * Recursion terminates when a base case is reached\n",
    "* Both gradually approach termination\n",
    "* Both can occur infinitely\n",
    "    * An infinite loop occurs with iteration if the loop-continuation test never becomes false\n",
    "    * Infinite recursion occurs if the recursion step does not reduce the problem in a manner that converges on the base case, or if the base case is mistakenly not tested"

    "### Negatives of Recursion\n",
    "* Recursion repeatedly invokes the mechanism, and consequently the overhead, of function calls\n",
    "* Can be expensive in terms of both processor time and memory space\n",
    "* Each recursive call causes another copy of the functionâ€™s variables to be stored in the stack frame\n",
    "    * Can consume considerable memory space\n",
    "* Iteration avoids these repeated function calls and extra memory assignments\n",
    "* However, for some algorithms that are easily expressed and understood with recursion, iterative solutions are not readily apparent"

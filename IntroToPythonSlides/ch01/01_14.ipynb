    "* Google’s Waze GPS navigation app, with its 90 million monthly active users, is one of the most successful big-data apps\n",
    "* Early GPS navigation devices and apps relied on static maps and GPS coordinates to determine the best route to your destination\n",
    "* They could not adjust dynamically to changing traffic situations \n",
    "* Waze processes massive amounts of **crowdsourced data** that’s continuously supplied by their users and their users’ devices worldwide\n",
    "* They analyze this data as it arrives to determine the best route to get you to your destination in the least amount of time"

    "* Waze communicates information over the Internet between their servers and their users’ mobile devices\n",

    "* Once Waze converts a spoken natural-language command to text, it must determine the correct action to perform, which requires natural language processing (NLP) (Chapter 12 and subsequent chapters)\n",
    "* Waze displays dynamically updated visualizations such as alerts and maps\n",
    "    * Waze also enables you to interact with the maps by moving them or zooming in and out (we create dynamic visualizations throughout the book, and display interactive maps in Chapters 13 and 17)"

    "    * Must process, store and analyze that data immediately to update your device’s maps, to display and speak relevant alerts and possibly to update your driving directions\n",
    "    * Requires massively parallel processing capabilities implemented with clusters of computers in the cloud (Chapter 17 in introduces various big-data infrastructure technologies) "

    "* Waze probably stores its routing information in a graph database\n",
    "    * Such databases can efficiently calculate shortest routes (we overview graph databases in Chapter 17)\n",
    "* Many cars are now equipped with devices that enable them to “see” cars and obstacles around them\n",
    "    * Used, for example, to help implement automated braking systems and are a key part of self-driving car technology\n",
    "    * Rather than relying on users to report obstacles and stopped cars on the side of the road, navigation apps could take advantage of cameras and other sensors by using deep-learning computer-vision techniques to analyze images “on the fly” and automatically report those items (deep learning for computer vision introduced Chapter 16)"

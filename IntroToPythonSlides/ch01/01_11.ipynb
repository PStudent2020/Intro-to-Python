    "# 1.11 Internet and World Wide Web \n",
    "* Late 1960s: ARPA—the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the United States Department of Defense—rolled out plans for networking the main computer systems of approximately a dozen ARPA-funded universities and research institutions\n",
    "* Computers were to be connected with communications lines operating at speeds on the order of 50,000 bits per second\n",
    "    * Stunning at a time when the few people with networking access were connecting a rate of 110 bits per second\n",
    "* ARPA implemented what became known as the ARPANET, the precursor to today’s Internet\n",
    "* Today’s fastest Internet speeds are on the order of billions of bits per second with trillion-bits-per-second (terabit) speeds already being tested!"

    "* Although the ARPANET enabled researchers to network their computers, its main benefit proved to be the capability for quick and easy communication via what came to be known as electronic mail (e-mail)\n",
    "* True even on today’s Internet, with e-mail, instant messaging, file transfer and social media such as Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter enabling billions of people worldwide to communicate quickly and easily\n",
    "* The protocol (set of rules) for communicating over the ARPANET became known as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n",
    "    * TCP ensured that messages, consisting of sequentially numbered pieces called packets, were properly delivered from sender to receiver, arrived intact and were assembled in the correct order"

    "* In parallel with the early evolution of the Internet, organizations worldwide implemented their own networks for intra-organization and inter-organization communication\n",
    "* Variety of networking hardware and software appeared\n",
    "* Challenge was to enable these different networks to communicate with each other\n",
    "* ARPA accomplished this by developing the Internet Protocol (IP), which created a “network of networks,” the current architecture of the Internet\n",
    "* Combined set of protocols is called TCP/IP"

    "* Businesses rapidly realized that by using the Internet, they could improve their operations and offer new and better services to their clients\n",
    "* Started spending large amounts of money to develop and enhance their Internet presence\n",
    "* Generated fierce competition among communications carriers and hardware and software suppliers to meet the increased infrastructure demand\n",
    "* Bandwidth—the information-carrying capacity of communications lines—on the Internet has increased tremendously, while hardware costs have plummeted"

    "* 1989: Tim Berners-Lee of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) began developing HyperText Markup Language (HTML)—the technology for sharing information via “hyperlinked” text documents\n",
    "* He also wrote communication protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to form the backbone of his new hypertext information system, which he referred to as the World Wide Web\n",

    "* More and more computing today is done “in the cloud”—that is, distributed across the Internet worldwide\n",
    "* Many apps you use daily are dependent on **cloud-based services** that use massive clusters of computing resources (computers, processors, memory, disk drives, etc.) and databases that communicate over the Internet with each other and the apps you use\n",

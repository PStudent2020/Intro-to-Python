    "### Module `doctest` and the `testmod` Function\n",
    "* **`doctest` module** helps you test your code and conveniently retest it after you make modifications\n",
    "* When you execute the `doctest` module’s **`testmod` function**, it inspects your functions’, methods’ and classes' docstrings looking for sample Python statements preceded by `>>>`, each followed on the next line by the given statement’s expected output (if any)\n",
    "* `testmod` executes those statements and confirms that they produce the expected output\n",
    "* If not, `testmod` reports errors indicating which tests failed so you can locate and fix the problems in your code\n",
    "* Each test you define in a docstring tests a specific _unit of code_, such as a function, a method or a class\n",
    "* Such tests are called **unit tests**"

    "    * Second test shows what the value of `account1`’s `name` attribute should be if the first test executed successfully \n",
    "    * Third test shows what the value of `account1`’s `balance` attribute should be if the first test executed successfully\n",
    "    * The last test creates an `Account` object with an invalid initial balance\n",
    "        * Sample output shows that a `ValueError` exception should occur in this case\n",
    "        * For exceptions, the doctest module’s documentation recommends showing just the first and last lines of the traceback\n",
    "* You can intersperse your tests with descriptive text"

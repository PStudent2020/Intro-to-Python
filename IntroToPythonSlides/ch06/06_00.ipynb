    "* Use dictionary and set comparison operators.\n",
    "* Combine sets with set operators and methods. \n",
    "* Use operators `in` and `not` `in` to determine if a dictionary contains a key or a set contains a value.\n",
    "* Use the mutable set operations to modify a set’s contents.\n",
    "* Use comprehensions to create dictionaries and sets quickly and conveniently.\n",
    "* Learn how to build dynamic visualizations and implement more of your own in the exercises.\n",
    "* Enhance your understanding of mutability and immutability."

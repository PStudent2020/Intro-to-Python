    "# 9.6 Focus on Security: `pickle` Serialization and Deserialization  \n",
    "* Python Standard Library’s **`pickle` module** can serialize objects into in a **Python-specific data format**\n",
    "* **Caution: The Python documentation provides the following warnings about `pickle`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “**Pickle files can be hacked**. If you receive a raw pickle file over the network, don’t trust it! It could have malicious code in it, that would run arbitrary Python when you try to de-pickle it. However, if you are doing your own pickle writing and reading, you’re safe (provided no one else has access to the pickle file, of course.)”\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Pickle is a protocol which allows the serialization of arbitrarily complex Python objects. As such, it is specific to Python and **cannot be used to communicate with applications written in other languages**. It is also **insecure by default**: deserializing pickle data coming from an untrusted source can execute arbitrary code, if the data was crafted by a skilled attacker.”"

    "* Read and write CSV files, a common format for machine-learning datasets.\n",
    "* Serialize objects into the JSON data-interchange format—commonly used to transmit over the Internet—and deserialize JSON into objects.\n",
    "* Use the `with` statement to ensure that resources are properly released, avoiding “resource leaks.”\n",
    "* Use the `try` statement to delimit code in which exceptions may occur and handle those exceptions with associated `except` clauses."

    "# Objectives (cont.)\n",

    "* Use the `try` statement’s `finally` clause to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs in the `try`. \n",
    "* `raise` exceptions to indicate runtime problems.\n",
    "* Understand the traceback of functions and methods that led to an exception.\n",

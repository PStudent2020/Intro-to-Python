    "* **Stemming** removes a **prefix** or **suffix** from a word leaving only a **stem**, which **may or may not be a real word**\n",
    "* **Lemmatization** is similar, but factors in the word’s **part of speech** and **meaning** and results in a **real word**\n",
    "* Both **normalize** words for analysis\n",
    "\t* Before calculating statistics on words in a body of text, you might convert all words to lowercase so that capitalized and lowercase words are not treated differently. \n",
    "* You might want to use a word’s root to represent the word’s many forms. \n",
    "\t* E.g., treat \"program\" and \"programs\" as \"program\""

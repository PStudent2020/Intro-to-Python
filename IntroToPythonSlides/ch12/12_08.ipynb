    "# 12.8 Machine Learning and Deep Learning Natural Language Applications\n",
    "* **Answering natural language questions**—For example, our publisher Pearson Education, has a partnership with **IBM Watson** that uses **Watson as a virtual tutor**. Students ask Watson natural language questions and get answers. \n",
    "* **Summarizing documents**—analyzing documents and producing **short summaries** (**abstracts**) that can, for example, be **included with search results** and can help you decide what to read. \n",
    "* **Speech synthesis (speech-to-text)**, **speech recognition (text-to-speech)**, **inter-language text-to-text translation**.\n",
    "* **Collaborative filtering**—used to implement **recommender systems** (“if you liked this movie, you might also like…”).\n",
    "* **Text classification**—e.g., **classifying news articles by categories**, such as world news, national news, local news, sports, business, entertainment, etc.\n",
    "* **Topic modeling**—finding the **topics** discussed in documents. \n",
    "* **Sarcasm detection**—often used with **sentiment analysis**.\n",
    "* **Text simplification**—making text **more concise** and **easier to read**.\n",
    "* **Speech to sign language and vice versa**—to enable a conversation with a hearing-impaired person.\n",
    "* **Lip reader technology**—for people who can’t speak, convert lip movement to text or speech to enable conversation. \n",
    "* **Closed captioning**—**automatically** adding text captions to video."

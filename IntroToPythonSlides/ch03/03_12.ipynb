    "### Requirements statement:\n",
    "> A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real-estate brokers. Last year, several of the students who completed this course took the licensing examination. The college wants to know how well its students did on the exam. You have been asked to write a program to summarize the results. You have been given a list of these 10 students. Next to each name is written a 1 if the student passed the exam and a 2 if the student failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Analyze the results of the exam as follows:\n",
    ">> Input each test result (i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the message “Enter result” each time the program requests another test result.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">> Count the number of test results of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Display a summary of the test results indicating the number of students who passed and the number of students who failed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> If more than eight students passed the exam, display “Bonus to instructor.”\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observations about the problem:\n",
    "    * The program must process 10 test results. We’ll use a for statement and the range function to control iteration.\n",
    "    * Each test result is a number—either a 1 or a 2. Each time the program reads a test result, the program must determine if the number is a 1 or a 2. We test for a 1 in our algorithm. If the number is not a 1, we assume that it’s a 2. \n",
    "    * We’ll use two counters—one to count the number of students who passed the exam and one to count the number of students who failed.\n",
    "    * After the script processes all the results, it must decide if more than eight students passed the exam so that it can bonus the instructor."

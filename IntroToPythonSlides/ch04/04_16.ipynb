    "* Function-call stack supports the function call/return mechanism. \n",
    "* Eventually, each function must return program control to the point at which it was called. \n",
    "* For each function call, the interpreter pushes an entry called a stack frame (or an activation record) onto the stack. \n",
    "* Contains the return location that the called function needs so it can return control to its caller. \n",
    "* When the function finishes executing, the interpreter pops the function’s stack frame, and control transfers to the return location that was popped.\n",
    "* The top stack frame always contains the information the currently executing function needs to return control to its caller. "

    "* States that code should be granted only the amount of privilege and access that it needs to accomplish its designated task, but no more. \n",
    "* An example of this is the scope of a local variable, which should not be visible when it’s not needed. \n",
    "* This is why a function’s local variables are placed in stack frames on the function-call stack, so they can be used by that function while it executes and go away when it returns. \n",
    "* The principle of least privilege  your programs more robust by preventing code from accidentally (or maliciously) modifying variable values that should not be accessible to it."

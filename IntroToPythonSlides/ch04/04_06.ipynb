    "* You write Python programs by combining functions and classes (that is, custom types) that you create with preexisting functions and classes defined in modules, such as those in the Python Standard Library and other libraries. \n",
    "* Avoid “reinventing the wheel.”\n",
    "* A module is a file that groups related functions, data and classes. \n",
    "* A **package** groups related modules. \n",
    "* The [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is provided with the core Python language. \n",
    "* Its packages and modules contain capabilities for a wide variety of everyday programming tasks. "

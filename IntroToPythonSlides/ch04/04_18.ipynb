    "# 4.18 Intro to Data Science: Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "* Considered the measures of central tendency—mean, median and mode. \n",
    "* Help us categorize typical values in a group.\n",
    "* An entire group is called a **population**. \n",
    "* Sometimes a population is quite large, such as the people likely to vote in the next U.S. presidential election, which is a number in excess of 100,000,000 people. \n",
    "* For practical reasons, the polling organizations trying to predict who will become the next president work with carefully selected small subsets of the population known as **samples**. \n",
    "* Hear we introduce **measures of dispersio**n (also called **measures of variability**) that help you understand how **spread out** the values are. \n",
    "* We’ll calculate each measure of dispersion both by hand and with functions from the module `statistics`, using the following population of 10 six-sided die rolls:\n",

    "### Variance\n",
    "* To determine variance, begin with the mean of these values—3.5. \n",
    "* Next, subtract the mean from every die value:\n",
    "> -2.5, -0.5, 0.5, -1.5, 2.5, 1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, -1.5\n",
    "* Then, square each of these results (yielding only positives):\n",
    "> 6.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, 6.25, 2.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, 2.25\n",
    "* Finally, calculate the mean of these squares, which is 2.25 (22.5 / 10)—this is the **population\n",
    "variance**. \n",
    "* Squaring the difference between each die value and the mean of all die values emphasizes **outliers**—the values that are farthest from the mean—which can be important in data analysis.\n",
    "* The following code uses the `statistics` module’s `pvariance` function to confirm our manual result:"

    "### What vs. How\n",
    "* Functional-style programming lets you simply say _what_ you want to do. \n",
    "* Typically, library code handles the _how_ for you. \n",
    "* Can eliminate many errors. \n",
    "* Functional-style programming emphasizes **immutability**. \n",
    "* Python’s `for` statement and `range` function _hide_ most counter-controlled iteration details. \n",
    "    * You specify _what_ values `range` should produce and the variable that should receive each value as it’s produced. \n",
    "    * Function `range` _knows how_ to produce those values. \n",
    "    * The `for` statement _knows how_ to get each value from `range` and _how_ to stop iterating when there are no more values. \n",
    "* Specifying _what_, but not _how_, is an important aspect of **internal iteration**—a key functional-style programming concept. \n",
    "* Stating what you _want_ done rather than programming _how_ to do it is known as **declarative programming**. "
